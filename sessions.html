       <p>Advances in information technologies are opening new ways to approach research
            and policy analysis for cities and regions. This is being driven in part by
            what is now referred to as ‘big data’ and also by the emergence of policies
            that are championing the ‘creative commons’ and ‘open data’. Harnessing the
            opportunities presented by these innovations is being championed by what is
            being referred to as ‘smart cities’. This paper overviews these developments
            and then focuses on how innovations in building new research infrastructures
            are starting to revolutionise the way urban and regional research might be
            facilitated through a number of initiatives that are occurring around the
            world. That includes the Australian Urban research Infrastructure (AURIN)
            project which is taken as an example. AURIN is a A$24million initiative by the
            Australian Government - led by the University of Melbourne but involving
            universities, research institutions and data agencies across the country -
            which is developing and operating a new national research infrastructure that
            facilitates access to a wide range of types of data at multiple levels of
            scale sourced from multiple sources with the on-line capability to integrate
            those data and interrogate data using open source spatial and statistical
            analysis and modelling e-research tools with visualization. An important
            feature of the AURIN e-research infrastructure is the capability to enable
            merit-based securitized access to unit record data and its integration with
            spatial objective data with the researcher not being able to download the
            individual data but conduct interrogation on-line and receive the results of
            those interrogations thus ensuring protection of privacy. The paper presents
            some of the applications that can be undertaken using the AURIN
            e-infrastructure capabilities. That includes: havesting spatial data and
            conducting econometric analysis and modelling; applying customised tools open
            source developed such as a Walkability tool and a Planning What If? Tool; and
            the integration of survey-based unit record data with spatial objective data.
            The paper concludes by discussing some of the impediments faced in this
            interface between ‘big data’, ‘smart cities’ and research infrastructure
            initiatives which are challenges that need to be addressed. </p>





            <h3> <a id="odonnell"></a>  <i>Residential Foreclosure and Non-Housing Wealth</i> </br>
                Coulson, Ed (Pennsylvania State University); 
                <u>O'Donnell, Sharon</u> (U.S. Census Bureau) </h3>

            <p>The foreclosure literature describes a "double trigger"
            mechanism that increases the probability that a homeowner will
            face foreclosure.  The double trigger is made up of a negative
            economic shock (e.g, job loss, divorce) and the presence of an
            underwater mortgage. In this paper, we examine the role of
            non-housing wealth on foreclosure probabilities.  Homeowners with
            underwater mortgages have more housing choices if they have
            sufficient non-housing assets that can be used to sell the home
            and payoff the deficiency. For those with only housing assets, the
            absence of non-housing assets intensifies the triggers.
 
            The presence of non-housing wealth also contributes to foreclosure
            probability if the homeowner uses the assets to purchase a second
            home and default on the first. This is a form of strategic default
            (""ruthless"" strategic default) exists if the homeowner has the
            means to keep current on the mortgage of the first home and has
            sufficient non-housing assets to pay off the deficiency but choose
            to apply it to the down payment of a second home.
             
            Analysis is based on a commingled file of 60 months of panel
            survey data (2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation
            (SIPP)) record linked at the address level with local government
            data that document stages of foreclosure of a portion of the SIPP
            mortgaged home. Data file contains monthly events of the
            households synchronized with foreclosure events.  
             
            Initial analysis, based on 40 months of panel data, show an
            association between homeowners in financial distress and defaults.
            Homeowners that feel the strongest effect of the local housing
            bubble on the value of their homes are at greater risk of default.
            Using two measures of non-housing assets, analysis failed to find
            any evidence between wealth and default.
             
            The paper does not determine who are motivated to engage in
            "ruthless" strategic default but empirical evidence suggests that
            less than 2.5% homeowners have the means to attempt it.</p>

                <u>Parker, Jason</u> (Michigan State University);
                and Loveridge, Scott (Michigan State University) </h3>

            <p>Community behavioral health includes positive mental health and freedom from
            substance abuse.  The incidence of conditions such as depression and
            alcoholism vary greatly from one place to the next and in a given location can
            change over time; sometimes, such as in the case of crystal meth, the
            incidence can grow rapidly.  Community behavioral health outcomes are produced
            by an array of resources that include formal and informal educational systems,
            law enforcement, health care providers, and social service workers.  Often
            this large array of participants works in an uncoordinated fashion due to poor
            information about emerging needs.  Local decision-makers seem to ignore many
            of the health data resources available to them, possibly because these
            resources appear after the fact, and don’t function well in predicting
            regional health problems.  Before the advent of data science, the first sign
            of a serious health crisis was the local news media.  Today, Google Trends
            provides new data that anyone can use to see patterns in search history at the
            regional level, including searches for web sites with information about
            illegal drugs and various mental health disorders.  Because the information is
            free of charge and offered in real time, rather than based on laborious
            population sampling, multiple reminders to obtain a defensible survey response
            rate, and data cleaning, using the new Google Trends data may also make it
            possible to construct powerful localized predictors of health crises so that
            regional planners, law enforcement officials, and social service agencies can
            react much more quickly.  The rich cyclicality of this data poses a serious
            statistical problem and must be estimated using a new panel frequency domain
            approach.  The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate use of Google Trend
            data in conjunction with more traditional covariates to provide accurate
            forecast equations for regional health problems so that local decision-makers
            can adjust their programs more quickly in response to emerging needs.  The
            covariates include measurements of unemployment, household income, local
            interest rates, demographics, regional government spending, and inequality.
            In our model, we control for local fixed effects and national common time
            effects so that our analysis is independent of any region-specific and
            year-specific differences.  Any remaining cross-sectional dependence between
            regions in the model can be accounted for by factor augmentation.</p>



            <h3> <a id="folch"></a>  <i>Fast Food Data: The Usefulness of Social Media Byproducts</i> </br>

            <p>The promise of “big” sets of user generated geographic content is that it
            provides a new way to understand cities. From a data collection perspective
            user-generated big urban data offers clear advantages: 1) it is available in
            real time and has very short update cycles and 2) it is inexpensive to collect
            in large part because it is often a byproduct of modern urban life. However,
            from a data use perspective the arguments for big urban data are much less
            compelling. There are real questions about the fidelity of big urban data to
            “real” on the ground conditions. Like “fast food”, big data is cheap and
            seemingly everywhere, but its quality is often suspect. Is big data a
            replacement for “traditional” data sources, a compliment to traditional data
            or simply a source of empty calories? Because big urban data sets are not
            designed studies in the formal statistical sense it is difficult to measure
            data quality. Thus much of the literature on big geographic data has focused
            on epistemological questions about what constitutes “good” user-generated
            content (Spielman 2014). These evaluations are further complicated when
            spatial accuracy is not necessarily the primary goal of the data collection
            process (Arribas-Bel, 2013). In this paper we examine the correspondence
            between Yelp (www.yelp.com) data and an administrative dataset of restaurants
            in the Phoenix, Arizona metro area produced by the Maricopa Association of
            Governments (MAG). Our initial goal was to examine the fidelity of Yelp to the
            “real world.” We assumed that the register of restaurants used for
            metropolitan planning purposes would represent reality and that Yelp would
            capture only some aspect of the “truth.” Instead we found little overlap
            between the administrative and “big” urban data sets. Extensive direct
            comparison revealed only about a third of restaurants in each dataset are
            found in the other. This lack of correspondence could be caused by trivial
            differences such as geocoding or spelling conventions, or it could indicate
            substantive differences in the data. We therefore turned to an indirect
            approach that compares the spatial distribution of the two datasets and found
            that they differ in systematic and predictable ways. Ripley’s Kdiff function
            (Bailey and Gatrell 1995), the difference between the expected number of
            restaurants within each dataset as a function of distance, indicates that
            across all spatial scales the Yelp data is significantly clustered relative to
            the MAG data. Specifically, restaurants in the MAG database are spread fairly
            evenly across the metro area while those in the Yelp data are more
            concentrated in certain parts of metro Phoenix, most notably the downtowns and
            upscale areas of Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Tempe. Further examination of the
            locations with a high density of Yelp restaurants suggests that they share
            some common traits. Areas with a high density of Yelp relative to MAG
            restaurants are in more walkable areas as judged by their average WalkScore.
            Additionally, logistic models using the US Census Longitudinal Employer
            Household Dynamics Database (http://lehd.ces.census.gov) indicate that census
            block groups with high probability of containing more Yelp than officially
            listed restaurants tend to have larger numbers of low-wage workers and people
            employed in the Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation sector and Accommodation
            and Food Services sector. These characteristics, combined with qualitative
            knowledge of the neighborhoods in question, begin to suggest that the Yelp
            data does an especially good job of documenting dense, hip areas, frequented
            by professionals, tourists, and the workers who serve them. MAG’s
            systematically collected data, on the other hand, is underrepresented in these
            areas, but is perhaps more complete in other parts of the metro area. Our
            comparison of Yelp and MAG data highlights the strengths and weaknesses of
            each. The two datasets had approximately the same number of restaurants, but
            the Yelp data is far more detailed and comprehensive in certain areas of
            Phoenix. It also may be better at documenting informal or family-run
            businesses, and it certainly is updated more frequently than MAG. However,
            Yelp does not represent the entire metro area equally, so analyses of Yelp
            data alone would likely overstate restaurant concentration in downtowns, and
            understate it in suburbs. MAG data may be less exhaustive in certain places,
            but due to its systematic construction it is likely to be more consistent
            across the entire region. Both datasets have a great deal of information to
            contribute. When combined, administrative and user generated databases seem to
            provide a more holistic and comprehensive picture of the world than either
            would do by itself. Effective planning might use the more evenly spread MAG
            data for metro-level research, supplementing it with Yelp data for detailed
            analysis of the neighborhoods well served by Yelp. The different strengths of
            the two datasets are just the most recent iteration of an established problem.
            Datasets on businesses have almost always been generated as the byproduct of
            some other commercial process. The nature of that process influences the form
            of the final dataset. By combining features of multiple datasets generated
            through different processes it may be possible to address the weaknesses of
            each.</p>

                <p>Electronic Medical Records data are a (relatively) newly
                available source of space, time data.  Particularly for
                regionally based large urban safety-net health systems, EMR
                data can allow for novel insights into the provision of health
                services for low-income under- and uninsured populations.
                However, the use and interpretation of EMR data has largely
                been unexplored and is quite challenging.  The data were
                collected for administrative purposes and are large.
                Additionally, there is a high level of sensitivity around data
                security and privacy when using EMR data.  Despite these
                challenges, we demonstrate the utility of EMR data to explore
                geographic and social influences on the outcomes in a
                Randomized Control Trial (RCT) by examining a RCT designed to
                increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Cadastral
                geocoding of EMR address records was used to validate patient
                addresses and to also append housing data from the count
                appraisal district to the EMR records.  Additionally, street
                network data was used to calculate travel times to the health
                clinics where health services were received.  We found
                statistically significant neighborhood effects. Most notably,
                average CRC test use among neighboring study participants was
                significantly and positively associated with individual
                patient’s CRC test use. This potentially important
                spatially-varying covariate has not previously been considered
                in health-behavior RCTs.  The implications are both empirical
                and methodological. Empirically, we find that in the case of
                the RCT examined, neighborhood effects, while significant, do
                not modify the intervention effect size estimates.
                Methodologically, our results contribute to the understanding
                of neighborhood effects and RCTSs.  RCTs of interventions
                intended to modify health behaviors may be influenced by
                neighborhood effects, which can impede unbiased estimation of
                intervention effects. Our results contribute to the growing
                literature suggesting that RCTs focused on individual behavior
                should assess potential social interactions between
                participants, which may cause intervention arm contamination.

            <p>This paper investigates the intra-urban spatial structure of labour market
            inequality. Comparing the spatial pattern of intra-urban inequality across
            cities has been difficult so far because of the requirement of standardized
            data collection at a very detailed spatial scale. The Research Data Centre
            (FDZ) of the Federal Employment Agency in the Institute for Employment
            Research (IAB) has recently accessed geocoded register data on the German
            labour market which cover the entire workforce liable to statutory social
            security and all working-age social benefit recipients. We use the year 2009
            wave of this data to construct measures for labour market inequality at the
            level of regular 500meter x 500meter grid cells, for example the local
            proportion of low-wage employees. These are the ground our further analysis
            bases on. We start our analysis with a case study on the three largest German
            cities: Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich. Visualisation of the social inequality
            measure at the level of grid cells forms a context for interpreting commonly
            employed metrics on intra-urban social segregation and other spatial
            structures in inequality. The three cities show distinctly shaped spatial
            structures in social inequality. Besides this, they differ with regard to the
            local economic development, the progress of structural change, and the policy
            of providing subsidised residences. In order to generalise this case-study
            evidence, we extend the analysis to cover all cities in Germany with more than
            100,000 inhabitants. We establish quantitative relations between measures for
            the shape of urban labour market inequality and the city size and growth, the
            industry structure, structural change, and social policy. We discuss
            instrumental variables which potentially allow for interpreting the estimated
            correlations in a causal fashion. Preliminary results (for the cities with
            population size over 500,000 persons) suggest a positive relationship between
            Duncan’s Segregation Index and the median wage within a city; with regard to
            other variables, relationships are less clear.</p>

        <p>A city means much more to its residents than just home and work. We eat out.
            We shop. We seek entertainment. We take advantage of the thousands of
            opportunities the city provides. While these choices are fundamental to how we
            use the city, they are also hard to observe. Surveys reveal what we say we do.
            Time diaries record what we do for how long, but not where we go. Even new GPS
            studies show where we go, but not why we go there or what other opportunities
            were relevant. In order to address these issues, we need information about
            individuals' residences and workplaces, places they go, and the alternatives
            available but not chosen. We need to pay attention not only to spatial
            frictions in the city but also to social frictions. And we need to be mindful
            that the spatial and social frictions themselves may vary with the
            characteristics of the residents. We construct the first data set that has all
            the features required to examine this problem. The starting point is data from
            the online user-generated review site, Yelp.com. In 2011, we downloaded all
            reviews written by about 50,000 Yelp users who had reviewed a venue in New
            York City. We randomly selected 25 percent of these users, jointly accounting
            for about 645,000 reviews, for closer study. We used a combination of keyword
            searches and close examination of review texts to identify approximate home
            and work locations for a subset of these users. We combine these locations
            with data on income levels and residential racial/ethnic composition from the
            2000 Census of Population. To measure racial/ethnic demographic distances
            between two census tracts, we calculate the Euclidean distance between the two
            tracts' population shares for four racial and ethnic groups. To measure
            segregation, we calculate the Echenique and Fryer (2007) spectral segregation
            index for the modal race/ethnicity in each census tract. This particular index
            has the property that a census tract is more segregated if it is surrounded by
            more segregated tracts. We estimate travel times between home, work, and
            venues as the public transit travel time between the centroids of New York
            City census tracts from Google Maps. We restrict our estimation sample to
            users with home and work locations in Manhattan in order to mitigate the issue
            of transport-mode choice, since the large majority of Manhattan residents use
            public transit. To describe crime rates, we use geographically precise NYPD
            robbery statistics that we aggregate to the level of census tracts. We infer
            users' genders from their profile photos on the Yelp web site. These data
            allow us to estimate a discrete-choice model of restaurant visits with a rich
            set of user and venue characteristics. They also allow us to examine the
            separate spatial frictions owing to distance of venues from home and work. We
            can relate characteristics of users to their willingness to enter areas of the
            city with varying crime rates, incomes, and racial composition. This allows us
            to understand how these social factors may act as barriers to movement and
            commerce within the city. Using our estimated demand system, we construct
            counterfactuals in which we examine how proposed transport infrastructure
            additions or reversion to higher crime rates affect the degree of integration
            (in many ways) of the city. Our preliminary results suggest influential roles
            for travel times, demographic differences, crime rates, and user
            characteristics. We find that the “demographic distance" between two locations
            is as important as the travel time between them. Women in particular are
            significantly less likely to visit venues in neighborhoods with high crime or
            racial and ethnic demographics different from those of their own
            neighborhood.</p>

    <u>Arribas-Bel, Dani</u> (University of Birmingham);
    Bakens, Jessie (VU University, Amsterdam) </h3>

            <p>This paper uses a novel source of (big) data to analyze the main factors
            behind the popularity of urban amenities in The Netherlands. In particular, we
            collect data from the location-based service Foursquare and employ it to
            obtain a rich catalogue of restaurant locations, as well as a database of
            other urban amenities. This, combined with traditional sources of
            socio-economic data, allows us to estimate regressions at the area and venue
            levels, uncovering the main determinants of the popularity of specific
            restaurants as well as of entire areas or neighborhoods of a city. In doing
            so, we contribute to the existing literature along three main dimensions: we
            provide insight and new knowledge about urban systems, in particular about the
            under-studied aspect of urban amenities; we demonstrate the use of a novel
            source of data available to urban researchers as a byproduct (Arribas-Bel
            2014) to improve the understanding of phenomena of interest not only to
            researchers but to practitioners such as urban planners and business owners;
            and we quantify, document and characterize some of the biases inherent to
            these new sources of data in the context of urban applications. From an
            economic point of view, cities have become not only agglomerations of
            production, but also important consumption arenas (Glaeser et al. 2001).
            Although this dual role is widely recognized by the literature, very little
            research has been devoted to analyze and identify the mechanisms that lead to
            attractive consumer cities. In other words, We know much more about the
            ingredients (i.e. cultural amenities, the presence of green open space,
            population composition) than about the recipe. How these elements are
            internally combined to create a successful “consumer city” remains largely
            uninvestigated. There are at least two possible reasons why this is the case:
            first, previous studies usually consider cities in the aggregate and have thus
            focused only on the elements, the ingredients, failing to recognize the
            spatial arrangement within each urban area; second, but very much related, it
            has been traditionally difficult to obtain spatially detailed data on revealed
            preferences for urban amenities. During the last few decades, the world has
            witnessed an explosion in computing power that has put a powerful computer in
            the pocket of even non-experienced users. In parallel, location technology
            such as the global positioning system (GPS) has also undergone dramatic
            improvements and sharp drops in cost, enabling it to reach the consumer mass.
            The combination of these two trends is producing a vast amount of
            geo-referenced data, presenting many opportunities for research in the urban
            realms. A prime example of this is the phenomenon known as location-based
            services (LBSs), of which Foursquare is one of the main industry players.
            These are online applications that allow users to broadcast their location in
            real-time in what has come to be known as a checkin. The accumulation of this
            form of metadata is producing databases that effectively store a digital
            representation of some aspects of the world, as well as many traces of human
            behaviour. We believe this can help fill the need for quantifiable measures of
            revealed preferences about urban amenities. </p>

            Cross, Philip (University of Leeds) </h3>

        <p>Much has been written about 'Big Data': definitions, characteristics, the
            methodological challenges it poses (Boyd and Crawford, 2012). There has also
            been speculation about how it may or may not revolutionise Regional Science
            and related fields (Arribas-Bel, 2014). Amongst the excitement, there has been
            little time to pause for thought and reflect about the kinds of application
            where Big Data is most suited. Indeed, Big Data also has its critics (e.g.
            Taleb 2012) and their arguments should be heeded to avoid the field being
            tainted, for example, with the type of controversy that has engulfed national
            spying agencies since the Snowden leaks, or similar concerns of the ‘Big
            Brother’ variety which have set the patient records agenda back in the UK
            (Ganesh, 2014). What is needed in this context, we argue, is not wide-eyed
            speculation about an ambiguous concept of 'Big Data', but an honest appraisal
            of the applications for which different kinds of emerging data sources may be
            most and least useful. Specifically, with the growing volume of data
            available, there has been a tendency to uncritically proceed with the
            analysis, resulting in beautiful visualisations and new insights. Yet in many
            cases careful evaluation of the quality of Big Data sources is lacking. It is
            the aim of this paper to discuss how quality can be evaluated in the realm of
            big data sources, by cross-validation. The theoretical underpinning of this
            paper goes back to the definition of Big Data as information that is high in
            volume, velocity and variety (Laney, 2001). Although this definition is
            frequently mentioned in talks on the subject, rarely are the criteria which
            constitute whether a dataset is 'Big' or not explored in detail. Furthermore,
            the consequences of each attribute for the types of application for which Big
            datasets are suited is rarely discussed. We thus start from the premise that
            each of the aforementioned attributes of Big Data can provide advantages and
            disadvantages to the researcher, in equal measures. One Big dataset may be
            completely different from the next in terms of its relative merits. We thus
            use three unrelated datasets for the empirical part of this study: Geotagged
            Twitter data: The Twitter data were collected with the Twitter Streaming
            Application Programming Interface (API), which provides 'live' access to
            public messages posted to Twitter. Data were collected during 445 days between
            2011-06-22 and 2012-09-09 in West Yorkshire. Mobile phone mast location data:
            A mobile telephone service provider provided aggregated data on home location
            as well as frequency and number of trips between major urban and retail
            centres across Yorkshire. Individual geolocated survey data on shopping
            habits: This dataset was provided by the consultancy Acxiom who do surveys
            across the UK, collecting ~1 million records yearly. The data has a fine
            spatial resolution (full postcode) and many attributes of interest for market
            research. The method was to test each dataset as an input into a spatial
            interaction model of movement between urban centres in Yorkshire, UK. In their
            raw form, it was found that each dataset is of little value to the majority of
            researchers, hence the term 'Big Noise'. It is only through a process of
            cleaning (to ensure consistency), filtering (to remove extraneous information)
            and aggregation that the raw datasets are transformed into a state that allows
            direct comparison between them and with the results of a spatial interaction
            model. We conclude by advocating a greater emphasis on these techniques of
            'data tidying' in Big Data research as this seems to be a major bottleneck in
            the field and an area where value researchers can add most value to noisy
            information.</p>

            Anselin, Luc (Arizona State University);
            Williams, Sarah (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) </h3>

        <p>This paper investigates the spatial footprint of “digital neighborhoods,”
            i.e., a concept of neighborhood derived from the content of geo-located and
            time-stamped social media messages, which greatly extend the usual range of
            local data available to urban and regional scientists. The messages pertain to
            different types of contents and activities that tend to cluster in space and
            over time. We are interested in using different spatial clustering techniques
            to detect significant groupings and how these can be explained by underlying
            socio-economic characteristics. In addition to the spatial dimension, we
            examine the space-time distribution of messages during the day and over the
            course of a week to assess the extent to which the digital neighborhoods are
            dynamic across time and over space, and how this varies by type of message. We
            base our analysis on two sources of social media data for a period in early
            2014 in New York City. One is a sample of over 5 million Twitter messages
            collected through February and March, of which close to 600,000 have
            geographic coordinates that correspond to over 450,000 venues. The second is a
            comprehensive set of Foursquare check-ins for the first week of February,
            which similarly contains close to 600,000 observations, but for a much smaller
            set of venues (65,000). In addition to the locations of the Twitter messages
            and the Foursquare check-ins, we consider more than 300,000 business locations
            from the comprehensive ESRI business data base. In our analysis, we take two
            different perspectives. In one, we take the geography of N.Y.C. block groups
            as the point of departure (n = 6454) and investigate the spatial and
            space-time density of messages within this framework. Using a variety of
            clustering methods (including measures of local spatial autocorrelation), we
            identify block groups that form “digital hot spots” and “digital deserts.” The
            former show much more digital activity than would be expected, given their
            population share or share of the business locations. The hot spots are
            dominated by Manhattan, but also include new up-and-coming areas, such as Long
            Island City in Brooklyn, Williamsburg and Smith and Court Street. Digital
            deserts are the opposite, block groups that are severely under-represented in
            the digital world. We relate these patterns to socio-economic characteristics
            of the block-groups in a series of spatial regressions. In the second
            perspective, we take the location of the venues as the point of departure and
            address clustering by means of association matrices, i.e., a type of distance
            measure based on the similarity of check-ins among individuals, by type of
            venue. This replicates the approach taken by the “Livehoods” project (Cranshaw
            et al, 2012), but we also focus on the sensitivity of the obtained clusters to
            the parameters chosen in the process of the clustering approach. In addition,
            we investigate the dynamics of these clusters over the course of the day and
            the day in the week. These digital neighborhoods help to highlight the
            underlying economic dynamics of the matching geographic neighborhoods and tend
            to have a higher diversity of businesses.</p>

            Schintler, Laurie </h3> 

        <p>Location sharing services (LSSs) enable individuals to “check-in”
        to locations via GPS-equipped devices, and to share this information
        with friends in real-time. These services, and other related
        applications, are generating a huge amount of passively collected data
        on social and spatio-temporal behavior. Unlike traditional sources of
        data, the information produced by LSS users has broad geographic
        coverage; it is also rich in spatial and temporal detail. In fact, a
        number of studies have already exploited this type of data to
        understand different aspects of human and societal behavior, including
        patterns of travel behavior. However, one concern about location
        sharing services data, as with other sources of Big Data, is that it
        is potentially biased.  Users of such services tend to correspond to a
        particular demographic – i.e., low to medium income males between the
        ages of 19-29.  Moreover, users can vary in the frequency with which
        they report their locations. For example, some individuals may only
        “check-in” when travelling long-distance, whereas others may do so on
        more of a regular basis. There may also be a bias in terms of the
        types of locations, or activities, that users report to their friends.
        To complicate matters, there may be differences in the demographics of
        users and their behavior across different location-sharing services.
        These differences could relate, for example, to the relative
        popularity of the services or stages of deployment. Without an
        understanding of these issues and sensitivities, any social or spatial
        behavior inferred from this type of data may end up being ad hoc,
        inaccurate, or ambiguous.  Thus, it is critical to understand who and
        what is being represented by the data, and how these characteristics
        differ across different services.  In this study, we begin to explore
        these issues. Specifically, the purpose of our study is three-fold:
        1). to assess how well LSS data captures daily travel behavior
        patterns; 2). to examine how sensitive the estimates are across
        different location-sharing services; and 3). to develop a methodology
        for processing location-sharing services data to derive information on
        average daily travel behavior. For the purpose of the study, we focus
        on two aspects of daily travel behavior: person miles of travel (PMT)
        and daily person trips (DPT). The location-sharing services we examine
        include Brightkite, Gowalla and Foursquare. We use the National
        Household Travel Survey (NHTS) estimates of PMT and DPT as benchmarks
        for the study.  The analysis is conducted at the national level
        (contiguous US) and for the top 51 most populated metropolitan areas
        in the contiguous US.  The study has five major findings: First,
        estimates of travel behavior from LSS data are found to be more
        accurate for populated rather than less-populated areas; Second, some
        variations in daily travel behavior are found in LSS data, although
        there are some consistencies, especially between Gowalla and
        Foursquare. Third, Brightkite is the least accurate in terms of
        representing daily travel behavior; Fourth, LSS data provides a better
        estimation of daily person miles of travel than average daily person
        trips; Lastly, discrepancies between the travel behavior inferred from
        LSSs and those from the NHTS seem to correspond to the particular
        demographics and travel characteristics of metropolitan areas.
        Through the sensitivity analysis of three LSS data with a comparison
        to the classical NHTS data, our results indicate that the accuracy of
        estimation for PMT and DPT using LSS data is highly dependent on the
        numbers of check-in records. Since metropolitan areas with high
        population density tend to have a better representation of daily
        travel pattern as compared to NHTS, the research findings suggest that
        it would be more accurate and suitable to use LSS data for travel
        behavior analysis with a focus on big metropolitan areas.</p>

<h3> <i>A framework of Mapping Social Connections in Space and Time</i> </br>
    <u>Ye, Xinyue</u> (Kent State University);
    Lai, Chih-Hui (Kent State University) </h3>

        <p>Emergency events such as natural disasters often precipitate the
            (re)activation of organized efforts in ways different from the normal times.
            Not only for individuals, organizations, including relief and non-relief
            related, often engage in intensive communicative action with individuals and
            organizations for offering and acquiring support of any kind. After the 2010
            Haiti Earthquake, Twitter has become an important emergency information and
            communication backbone where individuals and organizations request and share
            information for disaster relief within and outside the affected area. This
            unique system of information and communication allows for the identification
            of the dynamics of active and latent social connections as well as the
            temporal shifts of resource allocation geospatially. These geospatial details
            are either identified by the user in the text or automatically recorded by the
            system. To advance societal understanding about the transferability of virtual
            network systems into physical relief actions, this project aims to achieve
            four goals. First, it will examine the patterns of the global network of
            interorganizational communication on Twitter in two disaster contexts: 2012
            New York/New Jersey Superstorm Sandy and 2013 Typhoon Haiyan in the
            Philippines. These events are chosen because of their widespread impacts as
            well as their geographical variations, which allows for the observation of
            similar and divergent patterns of disaster relief. Analytically, this
            longitudinal analysis is meant to generate geospatial representation of the
            temporal change of the global virtual interorganizational network for each of
            these disasters. Findings will help illuminate the geo-economic disparities of
            organizational resource mobilization across disasters. Second, the analysis
            will identify the factors that differentiate the clusters of actors involved
            in different types of disaster relief around the world. As a result,
            volunteering coordination can be made more effectively by collaborating with
            relevant organizations falling within each cluster. Third, findings will
            locate the latent network of organizational collaboration for emergency
            response on a global scale. Predictions can be made about the timing and the
            geography of such network being activated before, during, and after disaster.
            These results will unveil the conditions and opportunities where the online
            links can translate into the provision of physical resources. Fourth, this
            research will reveal the broader patterns of global emergency and humanitarian
            aid network. In addition to disaster relief, most non-governmental and
            volunteer organizations are dedicated to multiple types of humanitarian aid.
            Using three disasters as the starting point will help identify the mechanisms
            of how virtual interorganizational network parallels or enhances the
            interorganizational collaboration for humanitarian efforts. Methodologically,
            supplementing the conventional survey and interview techniques, use of Twitter
            data allows for a more systematic way of obtaining data on different types of
            organizations (intergovernmental organizations, international, national, and
            local non-governmental organizations). It also enables longitudinal
            observation of the dynamic interaction among organizations of different types.
            In sum, this project presents significant scholarly, practical, and policy
            implications for disaster relief and humanitarian aid.</p>

        <h3> <i>New Data, New Applications:  A Methon for Transportation System Performance Monitoring</i> </br>
            Giuliano, Genevieve (University of Southern California);
            <u>Rhoads, Mohja</u> (University of Southern California);
            Chakrabarti, Sandip (University of Southern California) </h3> 


            <p>This paper is motivated by the availability of a new data source.  We have
            developed a data archive from the real-time data feed used for transportation
            system monitoring in the Los Angeles region.  This system, Regional
            Integration of Intelligent Transportation Systems (RIITS), includes freeway,
            arterial and public transit data produced by several state and local agencies.
            The availability of detailed, historical data across modes and facilities has
            obvious applications for transportation system modeling and simulation, but
            also provide opportunities for developing new analytical tools for
            transportation planning and management.  This paper presents a method for
            monitoring the regional transportation system.

            Performance monitoring is an essential part of transportation planning and
            system management, yet historically the cost and complexity of gathering
            sufficient data and conducting performance analyses has limited regular
            monitoring.  Our data archive includes geo-spatial freeway, arterial and
            transit operations data. The freeway and arterial data come from over 6,000
            sensors across Los Angeles County. The transit information comes from a
            combination of GPS devices and passenger counts from all Los Angeles Metro
            transit bus and rail routes. The data are generated in intervals as short as
            every 30 seconds, and all data are located by x-y coordinate. These data allow
            us to sample across time, space and modes at almost any time-space interval.

            In this paper we present our method for monitoring the highway system.  The
            transportation network is diverse.  Within the highway system, highways range
            from 2 lane rural roads to 12 lane urban freeways.  We therefore use cluster
            analysis based on functional attributes to group segments of the highway
            system.  Our cluster analysis yields three groups for the highway system.
            Operational data is not uniformly available:  some parts of the system are
            more instrumented than others, and not all sensors report valid data.  We
            therefore develop a weighting scheme to generate representative performance
            measures for each cluster group. 

            We illustrate our method using 30 days of data from the highway system.  Our
            results for highways using average speed, volumes, and variance as performance
            measures show that performance varies significantly across clusters, time
            periods and days of the week but different weighting schemes do not
            significantly affect results. </p>




            <h3> <i>Mobile phone data and motorway traffic: can the former
                    predict the latter?</i> </br>
                <u>Tranos, Emmanouil</u> (University of Birmingham)	</h3>
            
                <p>This paper aims to test the relationship between mobile
                phone usage and motorway traffic. Can we use data from mobile
                phone providers as a detector of motorway traffic? Such a
                modelling exercise can provide a useful tool for transport
                engineers as it will enable the (near) real-time estimation of
                car traffic in specific segments of motorways using data from
                mobile phone operators and avoiding the use of other more
                expensive and less efficient surveying techniques. The case
                study for our research is the city of Amsterdam. The data
                utilized for this paper has been supplied by a major telecom
                operator and provides aggregated information about mobile
                phone usage at the level of the GSM cell for the year 2010.
                The temporal dimension provides information at an hourly basis
                creating a very detailed pool of data. Such a rich dataset
                appears to be a ‘luxury’ for spatial analysts, but at the same
                time increases the complexity of the analytical approach. In
                addition, extensive datasets for motorway traffic using
                detection loops as well as weather data are also used for this
                paper. The richness of the mobile phone dataset will be
                utilised in two ways. At a first level, the effect of car
                traffic on mobile phone usage will be tested. The result of
                this exercise will provide the basis of the analysis as it
                will establish the relation between mobile phone usage and
                motorway traffic. At a second step the mobile phone dataset
                will be utilised in a more sophisticated way. Instead of using
                only data regarding mobile phone usage (e.g. new phone calls
                or erlangs), handovers will also be considered. The latter
                contains information regarding the transfer of calls from one
                GSM antenna to another. This usually happens when the mobile
                phone user crosses the boundaries of a GSM cell and therefore
                reflects movements in space. What is tested in the second step
                is that a low rate of handovers in relative terms can be
                related with bottle necks and traffic jams. Simply put,
                handovers during a traffic jams are, in relative terms, less
                than when roads are open. The latter will provide the main
                contribution of the paper as it will introduce a rather simple
                methodology to capture traffic jams at a (near) real time.</p>





          <h3> <i>Freight Deliveries Directly Generated by Residential Units:
                  An Analysis with the 2009 NHTS Data</i> </br>
              <u>Zhou, Yiwei</u> (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute); 
              Wang, Xiaokun (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) </h3>
                
               <p>As a result of the rapid growth of online shopping, more
               goods and services are delivered directly to residential units.
               The door-to-door deliveries improve residents’ accessibility to
               retailing sector, and at the same time create truck delivery
               trips. However, partially due to the data limitation, most
               existing freight research focuses on freight trips generated by
               the multiple industrial sectors, little is known about freight
               trips generated by residential units. As more and more urban
               areas are pushing for dense and mixed development, it is
               necessary to understand the pattern of truck freight trips
               directly generated by residential units. For this paper,
               dataset from NHTS is used to investigate the freight trips
               generated by residential units. NHTS 2009 provides accurate,
               comprehensive and timely information on trips, land use,
               household characteristics and social economic factors. It is
               the first time NHTS data is used to estimate freight trips. A
               statistical model is established to explain freight trips
               generated by residential units and discover influential
               factors. Besides, the model is expected to predict freight
               trips generated when applying to real residential units. A
               negative binomial right censored model is used to identify the
               impacts of influential factors such as housing density, type of
               house and house ownership. An application is made to simulate
               number of freight deliveries generated by residential units in
               New York City. Results are compared with derived real business
               freight trips data. To further validate simulation results, the
               same model is applied to different education groups. The
               simulated freight trips generated by residential units are
               compared to those using full dataset. A closer examination at
               the state level further discloses the spatial variation in
               their relationship. Such a study will supplement city logistics
               studies that traditionally focus on business behaviors, help
               reconstruct the complete picture of freight activities in urban
               areas.</p>




             <h3> <i>Baltimore’s Post-recession Socioeconomic Environment and Local Job Access for Work-eligible Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Recipients: a Locational Approach for Welfare-to-work Examination</i> </br>
                 <u>Zhang, Ting</u> (University of Baltimore) </h3>

              <p>This study examines the impact of Baltimore local community
              socioeconomic environment and local job access on work-eligible
              Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Recipients’
              welfare-to-work transfer propensity during the post-recession
              period between July 2009 and December 2012. The data we use
              include linked multi-agency micro level longitudinal
              administrative record extracts from Maryland state government
              and census block level public data from US Census Bureau,
              American Community Survey, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and
              Baltimore City Police Department. We adopt a hierarchical
              mixed-effect logistic regression, descriptive statistics, and
              spatial econometrics to estimate the impacts. ArcGIS will also
              be used to generate density maps, identify spatial hotspots and
              compute job access. The local community socioeconomic
              environment and the availability of the local jobs (defined by
              the location weighted job-hotspot-to-home distance) are critical
              to work-eligible TANF recipients’ employment outcome. This
              evidence-based study will inform Baltimore City government and
              local agencies, as well as Maryland State government agencies,
              of further strategies to redesign the TANF related social safety
              net services and service delivery in Central Baltimore area. The
              findings will not only identify the importance of home location
              and community environment to employment outcome and generate
              implications to welfare, planning and transportation policies,
              but also identify disparity of education, health, and family
              responsibility across industries. The study will conclude with
              policy implications and directions for future researches.
              Differences in local labor market opportunities and local
              socioeconomic community environment are critical to
              work-eligible welfare recipients. The February 2008
              Reauthorization of the TANF Program Final Rule defined personal
              responsibility and serious effort to work expectations for
              work-eligible welfare recipients. The access to local labor
              market opportunities and local socioeconomic community
              environment plays important roles in work-eligible TANF
              recipients’ job finding propensity. Previous literature has
              indicated the importance of local community socioeconomic
              environment for employment outcomes. Previous literature has
              also indicated that the long distance and commuting time to
              local labor market often affects individuals’ employment outcome
              for various reasons. Our study therefore hypothesize that local
              community socioeconomic environment and distance between home
              and potential job opportunities matter to TANF recipients’
              welfare-to-work transfer propensity. Local community demographic
              composition, income and poverty level, local transit conditions,
              and crime level are important factors affecting TANF recipients’
              job opportunities. The longer the distance between home and job
              opportunities, the lower the odds for them to find a job and
              this distance impact varies by industry. Considering the
              demographics of our observing TANF recipients, we also
              hypothesize child responsibility, lower education attainment,
              poorer health are associated with lower odds to find a job.</p>
